## About Brain Tumor 

A brain tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of cells in or around your brain. Together, spinal tumors and brain tumors are called central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

Brain tumors can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). Some tumors grow quickly, while others are slow growing.

## How is Brain Tumor diagnosed?

## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

An MRI uses magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the body. MRI can be used to measure the tumor’s size. 
A special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to create a clearer picture. This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow. 
MRIs create more detailed pictures than CT scans (see below) and are the preferred way to diagnose a brain tumor. 
The MRI may be of the brain, spinal cord, or both, depending on the type of tumor suspected and the likelihood that it will spread in the CNS. There are different types of MRI. 
The results of a neuro-examination, done by the internist or neurologist, helps determine which type of MRI to use.


Here we have 253 samples of Brain MRI images, 98 of which show no tumor and 155 show brain tumor.

Using **a Convolutional Neural Network**, **we try to classify whether the sample shows tumor or not**
